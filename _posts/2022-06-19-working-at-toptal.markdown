Toptal is a freelancer website which claims to hire top 3% of the world's talents. In this article I will share my experience working at Toptal as a freelancer. If you are looking to know about how to get in please check my [other article](/interviews/2021/12/16/how-i-get-into-toptal.html).


# Fully Remote

Most of the jobs are fully remote which means I can stay in any part of the world and deliver my work. If I need to sign a contract with a new client, there's not much on-boarding cost since I can just stay where I am.

# Qulity Clients

If you are already a freelancer, you already know what I am talking about. Clients play a vital role in having a good experince as a freenlancer. As part of Toptal, I got the opportunity to work for Fortune 100 companies of USA.

# Variety in Opportunities

Toptal offers freelancers the opportunity to select projects based on their personal interests and preferences. Working freelance allowed me to access more challenging development jobs in the international market compared to the local opportunities I was finding. Work in the USA is usually much more interesting with more advanced technologies.

Secondly, ff youâ€™re really specialized in web development, you can begin a transition into a space like DevOps by taking one or two smaller steps. That flexibility and the ability to make your own path is, for me, the biggest advantage.
